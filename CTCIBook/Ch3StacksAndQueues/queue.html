        //  CTCI Chapter 3 Interview Questions: 3.5 - Animal Shelter

        /*  An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates strictly
            on a "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest"
            (based on animal arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they
            can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive
            the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which animal
            they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system
            and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog,
            and dequeueCat. You may use built-in LinkedList data structure.
